# Fee Demand Management - Implementation Summary

## Overview

The fee demand management system has been implemented with automatic fee assignment to students. The flow is now:

1. **Fee Structure Creation** → Automatically assigns to all students in that grade
2. **Student Creation** → Automatically assigns all fee structures for their grade
3. **Fee Demand Management** → UI to manage individual student fees (discounts, adjustments)

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration

**File**: `db/migrations/0059_student_fee_demands_with_permissive_rls.sql`

Created the `student_fee_demands` table with:
- Links to students, fee structures, and schools
- Original amount, discount amount, and calculated demand amount
- Automatic triggers for calculating demand amounts
- Permissive RLS policies for development (to be tightened in production)

**Status**: ⚠️ **NEEDS TO BE APPLIED TO DATABASE**

#### How to Apply:
1. Go to https://pyzdfteicahfzyuoxgwg.supabase.co
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of `db/migrations/0059_student_fee_demands_with_permissive_rls.sql`
4. Paste and run in SQL Editor

### 2. Fee Structure API Enhancement

**File**: `web/src/app/api/admin/fees/structures/route.ts` (lines 157-201)

**Changes**:
- When a fee structure is created, it now automatically creates `student_fee_demands` records for all students in that grade
- The assignment happens in the background and won't fail the fee structure creation if it encounters errors

**Logic**:
```javascript
// After creating fee structure:
1. Fetch all students in the specified grade
2. For each student, create a student_fee_demand record with:
   - original_amount = fee structure amount
   - discount_amount = 0
   - demand_amount = original_amount (auto-calculated)
3. Log success/failure (doesn't block the request)
```

### 3. Student Creation Enhancement

**File**: `web/src/components/student-form-drawer.tsx` (lines 323-368)

**Changes**:
- When a student is created, it now automatically assigns all active fee structures for their grade
- The assignment happens after parent linking and won't fail student creation if it encounters errors

**Logic**:
```javascript
// After creating student:
1. Get current academic year (e.g., "2025-2026")
2. Fetch all active fee structures for the student's grade
3. For each fee structure, create a student_fee_demand record
4. Log success/failure (doesn't block student creation)
```

## User Flow

### School Admin Workflow:

#### 1. Creating Fee Structures
1. Navigate to **School Admin → Fees → Fee Structure**
2. Click "Add Fee Structure"
3. Fill in:
   - Academic Year (e.g., 2024-2025)
   - Grade (e.g., Grade 10)
   - Fee Category (e.g., Tuition Fee)
   - Amount
   - Payment Frequency
4. Click "Save"
5. ✅ **System automatically assigns this fee to all students in Grade 10**

#### 2. Adding New Students
1. Navigate to **School Admin → Students**
2. Click "Add Student"
3. Fill in student details including Grade
4. Click "Save"
5. ✅ **System automatically assigns all fee structures for their grade**

#### 3. Managing Fee Demands
1. Navigate to **School Admin → Fees → Fee Demand**
2. Select:
   - Class (Grade)
   - Section
   - Student
   - Academic Year
3. View all assigned fee structures for the student
4. Modify fees:
   - Add discount amount
   - Add discount reason (e.g., "Scholarship", "Sibling Discount")
   - View demand amount (auto-calculated as: original - discount)
5. Click "Save Fee Demands"

## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/admin/fees/demands`
Fetch student fee demands with filters:
- `school_id` (required)
- `student_id` (optional)
- `academic_year` (optional)

**Response**:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "student_id": "uuid",
      "fee_structure_id": "uuid",
      "academic_year": "2024-2025",
      "original_amount": 5000.00,
      "discount_amount": 500.00,
      "discount_reason": "Sibling discount",
      "demand_amount": 4500.00,
      "students": { "full_name": "John Doe", ... },
      "fee_structures": { "fee_categories": { "name": "Tuition Fee" } }
    }
  ]
}
```

### POST `/api/admin/fees/demands`
Save/update student fee demands (bulk operation):

**Request**:
```json
{
  "demands": [
    {
      "student_id": "uuid",
      "fee_structure_id": "uuid",
      "academic_year": "2024-2025",
      "original_amount": 5000.00,
      "discount_amount": 500.00,
      "discount_reason": "Scholarship",
      "demand_amount": 4500.00
    }
  ]
}
```

## Database Schema

### Table: `student_fee_demands`

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Primary key |
| school_id | UUID | FK to schools |
| student_id | UUID | FK to students |
| fee_structure_id | UUID | FK to fee_structures |
| academic_year | VARCHAR(20) | Academic year (e.g., "2024-2025") |
| original_amount | DECIMAL(10,2) | Original fee amount from structure |
| discount_amount | DECIMAL(10,2) | Discount given to student |
| discount_reason | TEXT | Reason for discount |
| demand_amount | DECIMAL(10,2) | Final amount (auto-calculated) |
| created_by | UUID | FK to users (audit) |
| updated_by | UUID | FK to users (audit) |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | Creation timestamp |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | Update timestamp |

**Constraints**:
- Unique: (school_id, student_id, fee_structure_id, academic_year)

**Indexes**:
- (school_id, student_id)
- (academic_year)
- (fee_structure_id)

**Triggers**:
- Auto-calculate `demand_amount` = `original_amount` - `discount_amount`
- Auto-update `updated_at` timestamp

## Testing Checklist

Once the migration is applied, test the following:

### ✅ Fee Structure Auto-Assignment
1. [ ] Create a new fee structure for a grade with existing students
2. [ ] Check that all students in that grade have the fee demand created
3. [ ] Navigate to Fee Demand and verify you can see the fees

### ✅ Student Auto-Assignment
1. [ ] Create a new student in a grade with existing fee structures
2. [ ] Check that the student gets all fee structures for their grade
3. [ ] Navigate to Fee Demand and verify the student's fees

### ✅ Fee Demand Management
1. [ ] Select a student in Fee Demand management
2. [ ] View their assigned fee structures
3. [ ] Add a discount to one fee
4. [ ] Add a discount reason
5. [ ] Save and verify the demand amount is calculated correctly
6. [ ] Reload the page and verify the changes persisted

## Error Handling

All automatic fee assignments are designed to fail gracefully:
- If fee assignment fails during fee structure creation, the structure is still created
- If fee assignment fails during student creation, the student is still created
- Errors are logged to console for debugging
- User sees success message for the primary operation (student/fee structure creation)

## Production Considerations

### Security
The current RLS policies are permissive (allow all operations). For production:

1. Update RLS policies to restrict based on user roles:
```sql
-- Example: Only school admins can view their school's demands
CREATE POLICY student_fee_demands_select_policy ON student_fee_demands
    FOR SELECT
    USING (
        school_id IN (
            SELECT school_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()
        )
    );
```

2. Add proper authentication checks in API routes

### Performance
For large schools (1000+ students):
- Consider adding pagination to fee demand listing
- Batch fee assignments in smaller chunks
- Add database connection pooling
- Monitor query performance

### Data Integrity
- Add validation for discount amounts (shouldn't exceed original amount)
- Add audit logging for fee modifications
- Consider approval workflow for large discounts

## Next Steps

1. **Apply the migration** to create the `student_fee_demands` table
2. **Test the complete flow** as outlined above
3. **Handle existing students**: If you have students already in the system, you may need to run a one-time script to assign fee structures to them
4. **Tighten RLS policies** for production security
5. **Add fee invoicing**: Generate invoices based on fee demands
6. **Add payment tracking**: Link payments to fee demands
