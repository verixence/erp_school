## üìù API Usage Examples

### Create Expense Type
```javascript
POST /api/admin/fees/expense-types?school_id={schoolId}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Insurance",
  "description": "Insurance premium payments",
  "is_active": true
}
```

**Response (200)**:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Insurance",
    "description": "Insurance premium payments",
    "is_active": true,
    "created_at": "2025-10-13T..."
  }
}
```

### Create Bank Account
```javascript
POST /api/admin/fees/bank-accounts?school_id={schoolId}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "account_name": "School Main Account",
  "bank_name": "STATE BANK OF INDIA",
  "account_number": "SBI19652025",
  "ifsc_code": "SBIN0001234",
  "branch_name": "Main Branch",
  "account_type": "current",
  "opening_balance": 100000.00,
  "is_primary": true,

}
```

**Auto-calculated fields**:

- `remaining_cheques`: 1377 (initially equals total_cheques)
- `used_cheques`: 0 (starts at 0)

## ‚ö° Performance Optimizations

1. **Change Tracking**: Only modified records are sent to the server (implemented in Fee Demand Management)
2. **React Query Caching**: Reduces unnecessary API calls
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback
4. **Debounced Search**: Search input debounced to reduce queries
5. **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed

---

## üîí Security Features

1. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level tenant isolation
2. **Input Validation**: Zod schemas validate all inputs
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries
4. **CSRF Protection**: Built into Next.js
5. **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents runtime errors

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Database Migration Required
**Status**: Migration file created but not applied

**Action Required**:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `db/migrations/0060_expense_types_and_cheque_books.sql`
3. Execute the SQL
4. Verify tables are created

### Missing Tables (Not Critical)
- `school_expenses` table (for expense tracking) - shows errors in logs but doesn't break functionality
- `student_fee_demands` table - created in previous migration

---

## üìö Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Bulk Operations**: Import/Export expense types and cheque books via CSV
2. **Audit Trail**: Track who created/modified records
3. **Soft Delete**: Keep deleted records for audit purposes
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter cheque books by status, date range
5. **Reporting**: Generate reports for bank accounts and expenses
6. **Cheque Register Integration**: Link issued cheques to payment vouchers
7. **Bank Reconciliation**: Match transactions with bank statements

### Technical Improvements
1. **Unit Tests**: Add Jest/Vitest tests
2. **E2E Tests**: Playwright tests for critical flows
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Add analytics and error tracking
4. **Internationalization**: Multi-language support
5. **Theming**: Custom color schemes per school

---

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "School ID not found" Error
**Cause**: User session doesn't have school_id
**Fix**: Re-login to refresh session

#### "Failed to fetch" Errors
**Cause**: Tables don't exist in database
**Fix**: Apply migration `0060_expense_types_and_cheque_books.sql`

#### Navigation Not Working
**Cause**: JavaScript not loaded or URL routing issue
**Fix**: Clear browser cache and reload

#### Modal Not Opening
**Cause**: State management issue
**Fix**: Check browser console for React errors
