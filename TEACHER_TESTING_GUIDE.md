# üéØ Teacher Portal Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ **Authentication Issue Fixed!**

**Problem**: Teachers were getting "Access Denied" after successful login.
**Root Cause**: Middleware was looking for wrong cookie names (`sb-access-token` instead of Supabase's default cookies).
**Solution**: Updated middleware to use proper Supabase cookie-based authentication.

## üöÄ **Quick Test Steps**

### 1. Start the Web Application
```bash
# From project root
npm run dev:teacher:web

# Application will start on http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Test Teacher Login
Use any of these teacher accounts from the debug results:

| Email | Password | School | Name |
|-------|----------|--------|------|
| john@yopmail.com | teacher123 | School 1 | John Paul |
| jamy@yopmail.com | teacher123 | School 2 | Jamy Marc |
| stacy@yopmail.com | teacher123 | School 2 | Stacy CM |
| zimpa@yopmail.com | teacher123 | School 2 | Zimpa D |
| marina@yopmail.com | teacher123 | School 1 | Marina D |

### 3. Expected Flow
1. **Login Page**: Enter teacher credentials
2. **Authentication**: Should successfully authenticate
3. **Redirect**: Should redirect to `/teacher` (Teacher Dashboard)
4. **Access**: No more "Access Denied" errors!

-- db/migrations/0007_teacher_assets.sql

-- This creates:
-- - timetables table
-- - homeworks table  
-- - announcements table
-- - Sample data for testing
```

### Sample Data Available
- **Timetables**: Pre-populated schedules for testing
- **Homeworks**: Sample assignments
- **Announcements**: Test announcements
