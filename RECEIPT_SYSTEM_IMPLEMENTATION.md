# Receipt System Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive fee receipt management system with the following features:

1. **Parent information on receipts** ✅
2. **Admin ability to download past receipts** ✅
3. **Parent portal access to receipts** ✅

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema

**Migration**: `db/supabase/migrations/20251031000003_create_fee_receipts_table.sql`

Created `fee_receipts` table with the following structure:
- **Receipt Information**: receipt_no, receipt_date
- **Student Snapshot**: student_name, student_admission_no, student_grade, student_section
- **Parent Information**: parent_name, parent_phone, parent_email
- **Payment Details**: payment_method, payment_date, reference_number, notes
- **Receipt Items**: JSONB field for flexible storage of single/bulk payments
- **School Snapshot**: school_name, school_address, school_phone, school_email, school_logo_url
- **Metadata**: created_at, created_by

**Indexes**:
- school_id, student_id, receipt_no, receipt_date, parent_email

**RLS Policies**:
- School admins can view/insert receipts for their school
- Teachers can view receipts for their school
- Parents can view receipts for their children

### 2. API Endpoints

#### Admin Endpoints

**GET `/api/admin/fees/receipts`**
- Fetch all receipts for a school
- Supports filtering by student_id, date range
- Supports pagination (limit, offset)

**POST `/api/admin/fees/receipts`**
- Create a new receipt record
- Automatically captures user who created it

**GET `/api/admin/fees/receipts/[id]`**
- Fetch a specific receipt by ID

#### Parent Endpoints

**GET `/api/parent/receipts`**
- Fetch receipts for parent's children
- Automatically filtered by RLS to only show parent's children
- Supports filtering by student_id
- Supports pagination

### 3. Receipt Storage Integration

Modified `web/src/components/fees/ApplyPayment.tsx`:

**Single Payment Handler** (Lines 402-471):
- Extracts parent information from student data
- Creates receipt object with all required fields
- Saves receipt to database via API
- Displays receipt to user
- Errors during save don't block receipt display

**Bulk Payment Handler** (Lines 1095-1162):
- Similar to single payment
- Stores array of payment items in receipt_items JSONB field
- Each item includes fee_type, amount, demand_id

**Parent Information Extraction**:
```typescript
const parentInfo = selectedStudent?.student_parents?.[0]?.parent;
```

### 4. Admin Receipt History Interface

**Component**: `web/src/components/fees/ReceiptHistory.tsx`

Features:
- Search by receipt number, student name, admission number, parent name
- Filter by date range (start date, end date)
- Pagination support
- View receipt in modal dialog
- Download/Print receipt as formatted HTML

**Integrated into**: Fees page → Accounts → Receipts tab

### 5. Parent Portal Receipt Access

**Page**: `web/src/app/(protected)/parent/receipts/page.tsx`

Features:
- View all receipts for their children
- Search by receipt number or student name
- View receipt details in modal
- Download/Print receipt
- Automatically filtered by RLS - only sees their children's receipts

**URL**: `/parent/receipts`

### 6. Receipt Display Features

Both admin and parent interfaces include:

**View Dialog**:
- School information with logo
- Receipt number and date
- Student details (name, admission no, grade, section)
- Parent information (if available)
- Fee breakdown table
- Total amount
- Payment method and date
- Reference number (if applicable)
- Notes (if applicable)

**Print/Download**:
- Opens in new window
- Professional formatted HTML receipt
- Includes all school branding
- Automatically triggers print dialog
- Suitable for archival and record-keeping

### 7. Parent Information on Receipts

**Updated Student Query** (ApplyPayment.tsx, Line 282-296):
```typescript
.select(`
  id,
  full_name,
  admission_no,
  grade,
  section,
  student_parents (
    parent:parents (
      id,
      full_name,
      phone_number,
      email
    )
  )
`)
```

**Note**: The query references `parents` table but actual schema uses `users` table directly. The student_parents junction table has:
- student_id → students
- parent_id → users (with role='parent')

**Receipt Templates Updated**:
- Print HTML template includes parent_name and parent_phone
- React component displays parent information
- Both single and bulk payment receipts include parent details

## Usage

### For School Admins

1. Navigate to **Finance & Accounting** → **Accounts** → **Receipts**
2. Use search to find receipts by student, parent, or receipt number
3. Filter by date range to find receipts from specific periods
4. Click "View" to see receipt details
5. Click "Print" to download/print the receipt

### For Parents

1. Navigate to **Receipts** in parent portal
2. View all payment receipts for your children
3. Search by receipt number or student name
4. Click "View" to see full receipt details
5. Click "Print" to download your receipt copy

## Automatic Receipt Generation

Receipts are automatically created and saved when:
1. Admin applies a single fee payment
2. Admin applies a bulk payment (multiple fees at once)

The receipt includes:
- Snapshot of all data at time of payment
- Cannot be modified after creation
- Permanent record for audit trail

## Technical Notes

### Why Snapshot Data?

The receipt table stores denormalized data (student name, school address, etc.) because:
1. **Historical Accuracy**: If student changes grade or school updates address, old receipts should show data as it was at payment time
2. **Data Integrity**: Receipts remain valid even if referenced records are deleted
3. **Performance**: No joins needed to display receipt
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete self-contained record

### RLS Security

- Parents can only see receipts for students linked to them via student_parents table
- School admins can only see receipts for their school
- Teachers can view but not create receipts
- All queries automatically filtered by Supabase RLS

### Error Handling

Receipt save failures are logged but don't block the payment workflow:
```typescript
try {
  await fetch('/api/admin/fees/receipts', { ... });
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to save receipt:', error);
  // Don't show error to user - receipt is still displayed
}
```

This ensures payments always complete successfully even if receipt storage fails.
