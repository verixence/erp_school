# 🚀 Performance Optimization - Applied Fixes

## Issue: App Sometimes Doesn't Load / Needs Hard Refresh

### Root Causes Identified & Fixed

---

## ✅ **Fix 1: Brand Loading No Longer Blocks App**

### Problem
- Teacher and Parent layouts waited indefinitely for school brand data
- If brand loading failed or took too long, the entire app appeared frozen
- Users saw endless loading screen with no way to proceed

### Solution Applied
**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/app/teacher/layout.tsx`
- `web/src/app/(protected)/parent/layout.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Added `retry: 2` and `retryDelay: 1000` to brand queries
2. ✅ Added `staleTime: 5 minutes` and `gcTime: 30 minutes` for caching
3. ✅ Added `error: brandError` to detect failures
4. ✅ **Critical:** App now proceeds with default styling if brand fails
5. ✅ Added timeout warning after 3 seconds
6. ✅ Only blocks initial render, not error states

**Before:**
```typescript
if (brandLoading || !brand) {
  return <LoadingScreen />; // ❌ Blocks forever if fails
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (brandLoading && !brandError && !brand) {
  // Shows loading only for initial fetch
  // Times out after 3 seconds with warning
}
if (brandError) {
  console.warn('Failed to load school brand, using default styling');
  // ✅ App continues with default styling!
}
```

## ✅ **Fix 2: Optimized Dashboard Auto-Refresh**

### Problem
- School Admin Dashboard refreshed every 30 seconds
- Attendance Analytics refreshed every 30 seconds
- Caused unnecessary server load
- Made app feel sluggish when queries were slow

### Solution Applied
**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/app/(protected)/school-admin/page.tsx`
- `web/src/app/(protected)/school-admin/dashboard/components/AttendanceAnalytics.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Reduced refresh interval from **30 seconds → 5 minutes**
2. ✅ Added `staleTime: 2 minutes` - data considered fresh for 2 min
3. ✅ Added `gcTime: 10 minutes` - keeps data in cache longer
4. ✅ Added `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` - doesn't refetch when switching tabs
5. ✅ Added `retry: 2` for failed requests

**Impact:**
- **90% reduction** in API calls (from every 30s to every 5min)
- Faster page navigation (cached data reused)
- Reduced server load significantly

**Before:**
```typescript
refetchInterval: 30000, // Every 30 seconds ❌
```

**After:**
```typescript
staleTime: 2 * 60 * 1000, // Cache for 2 minutes
gcTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // Keep in cache for 10 minutes
refetchInterval: 5 * 60 * 1000, // Refresh every 5 minutes ✅
refetchOnWindowFocus: false, // Don't refetch on tab switch ✅
retry: 2,
```

## ✅ **Fix 3: Fixed Manual User Fetching in Inventory**

### Problem
- Inventory page manually fetched user data with `useEffect`
- Could fail silently without user noticing
- Didn't leverage existing `useAuth` hook and caching
- No error handling if fetch failed

### Solution Applied
**File Modified:**
- `web/src/app/(protected)/school-admin/inventory/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Removed manual `useEffect` user fetching
2. ✅ Now uses `useAuth()` hook (consistent with rest of app)
3. ✅ Added proper loading state
4. ✅ Added error state with user-friendly message
5. ✅ Added `staleTime` and `retry` to dashboard query

**Before:**
```typescript
const [schoolId, setSchoolId] = useState<string | null>(null);
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchUser = async () => {
    // Manual fetch that could fail silently ❌
    const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
    // ... more code
  };
  fetchUser();
}, []);
```

**After:**
```typescript
const { user } = useAuth(); // ✅ Uses existing hook with caching
const schoolId = user?.school_id;

// ✅ Proper error handling
if (dashboardError) {
  return <ErrorMessage />;
}
```

---

## ✅ **Fix 4: Added Timeout & Error Handling**

### Problem
- Queries could hang indefinitely without timeout
- No visual feedback when queries fail
- Users didn't know if app was loading or stuck

### Solution Applied
**All Modified Files**

**Changes:**
1. ✅ Added `retry: 2` to all critical queries (failed queries retry twice)
2. ✅ Added `retryDelay: 1000` (1 second between retries)
3. ✅ Added explicit error states with user-friendly messages
4. ✅ Added timeout warnings in console
5. ✅ App proceeds with defaults if non-critical data fails

**Example:**
```typescript
const { data, error } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['key'],
  queryFn: fetchData,
  retry: 2, // ✅ Retry failed requests
  retryDelay: 1000, // ✅ 1 second between retries
  staleTime: 2 * 60 * 1000, // ✅ Cache for 2 minutes
});

if (error) {
  // ✅ Show error message, don't block app
  return <ErrorFallback />;
}
```

---

## ✅ **Fix 5: Improved Caching Strategy**

### Changes Across All Queries
1. ✅ Added `staleTime` - how long data is considered fresh
2. ✅ Added `gcTime` (garbage collection time) - how long cached data is kept
3. ✅ Disabled `refetchOnWindowFocus` where not needed

**Benefits:**
- Faster navigation (data reused from cache)
- Fewer API calls
- Better offline experience
- Reduced loading states

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Before Optimization:
- ❌ App could freeze if brand fails to load
- ❌ Dashboard refreshed every 30 seconds
- ❌ No caching - every navigation triggered new API calls
- ❌ Manual user fetching prone to failures
- ❌ No timeout handling

### After Optimization:
- ✅ App always loads, even if brand fails (uses defaults)
- ✅ Dashboard refreshes every 5 minutes (10x less frequent)
- ✅ Aggressive caching - data reused for 2-10 minutes
- ✅ Consistent `useAuth` hook usage
- ✅ Proper error handling and timeouts
- ✅ **90% reduction in API calls**
- ✅ **Faster page navigation**
- ✅ **No more stuck loading states**

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Query Configuration Standards (Now Applied):

```typescript
useQuery({
  queryKey: ['key', params],
  queryFn: fetchData,
  
  // Timing
  staleTime: 2 * 60 * 1000, // 2 minutes - data considered fresh
  gcTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes - keep in cache
  refetchInterval: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes - auto-refresh (if needed)
  
  // Behavior
  refetchOnWindowFocus: false, // Don't refetch on tab switch
  enabled: !!dependency, // Only fetch when ready
  
  // Error Handling
  retry: 2, // Retry failed requests twice
  retryDelay: 1000, // 1 second between retries
});
```

## 🚀 Next Steps (Recommendations)

### Additional Optimizations to Consider:

1. **Add React Query Devtools** (already installed)
   - Monitor cache status
   - Debug slow queries
   - Track refetch behavior

2. **Implement Background Sync**
   - Pre-fetch likely next pages
   - Refresh stale data in background
   - Optimize for common user journeys

3. **Add Loading Skeletons**
   - Better perceived performance
   - Users see structure while loading
   - Reduces feeling of "stuck"

4. **Monitor Performance Metrics**
   - Track Time to Interactive (TTI)
   - Monitor API response times
   - Set up error tracking (Sentry)

5. **Consider Service Workers**
   - Offline support
   - Background data sync
   - Push notifications

## ✅ Testing Checklist

Test these scenarios to verify fixes:

- [ ] Navigate to Teacher/Parent portal - should load even if slow network
- [ ] Switch between dashboard tabs - should use cached data
- [ ] Leave dashboard open for 10 minutes - should only refresh after 5 min
- [ ] Disconnect network temporarily - app should handle gracefully
- [ ] Refresh page multiple times quickly - should load instantly from cache
- [ ] Go to inventory page - should use `useAuth` hook properly

---

## 📞 Support

If you still experience loading issues:

1. **Check Browser Console** - Look for error messages or warnings
2. **Check Network Tab** - Verify API calls are completing
3. **Clear Cache** - Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Check Supabase Status** - Verify database is accessible
5. **Monitor Query Status** - Use React Query Devtools
