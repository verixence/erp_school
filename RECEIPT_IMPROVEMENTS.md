# Fee Payment Receipt Improvements ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ School Address Showing as JSON
**Before**: Address displayed as raw JSON object:
```
{"city":"Hyd","state":"TG","street":"123 alsdf sdf","country":"ind","postal_code":"43234"}
```

**After**: Properly formatted address:
```
123 alsdf sdf, Hyd, TG, ind, 43234
```

**Fix**: Changed from `JSON.stringify(schoolData?.address)` to using the existing `formatAddress()` helper function.

---

### 2. ✅ Missing Contact Information
**Before**: Receipt only showed school name and address

**After**: Receipt now includes:
- ✅ School Name
- ✅ Formatted Address
- ✅ Phone Number
- ✅ Email Address
- ✅ Receipt Title

## How formatAddress() Works

The helper function (line 74-84) converts JSON address to readable format:

```typescript
const formatAddress = (address: any): string => {
  if (typeof address === 'string') return address;
  if (!address) return '';

  const parts = [];
  if (address.street) parts.push(address.street);
  if (address.city) parts.push(address.city);
  if (address.state) parts.push(address.state);
  if (address.country) parts.push(address.country);
  if (address.postal_code) parts.push(address.postal_code);

  return parts.join(', ');
};
```

**Input**:
```json
{
  "street": "123 alsdf sdf",
  "city": "Hyd",
  "state": "TG",
  "country": "ind",
  "postal_code": "43234"
}
```

**Output**:
```
123 alsdf sdf, Hyd, TG, ind, 43234
```
