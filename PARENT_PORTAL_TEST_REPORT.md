# Parent Portal - Test Report

**Date:** $(date)  
**Phase:** Phase 5 Implementation  
**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED**

## 🎯 Implementation Overview

The parent portal has been successfully implemented as a protected route within the ERP school system. All routing conflicts have been resolved and the authentication middleware is working correctly.

**Note:** The student portal has been removed from the application. Student data is now managed through the school admin interface, and parents can view their children's information through the parent portal.

## ✅ **VERIFIED COMPONENTS**

### 1. **Routing & Authentication**
- ✅ **Parent Portal (`/parent`)** - Routes correctly to `ParentLayout`
- ❌ **Student Portal** - **REMOVED** from the application
- ✅ **Authentication Middleware** - Properly redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
- ✅ **No Routing Conflicts** - Removed conflicting routes outside protected group
- ✅ **Protected Route Group** - Parent portal correctly uses `(protected)` route group

### 2. **Parent Portal Pages**
| Page | Route | Status | Component |
|------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Dashboard | `/parent` | ✅ Implemented | `ParentDashboard` |

- **School Admin**: `admin@sunriseschool.edu`
- **Teacher**: `math.teacher@sunriseschool.edu`
- **Parent**: `parent@sunriseschool.edu`

## ⚠️ **Current Limitations**

### Database Setup Issue
- ❌ **Supabase CLI Not Available** - Cannot run migrations locally
- ❌ **Seed Script Failing** - Needs Supabase environment variables
- ⚠️ **Demo Data Missing** - Cannot test with actual user accounts

### What Still Needs Testing
1. **Authenticated Access** - Need to test with actual logged-in parents
2. **Data Loading** - Verify API calls work with real database data
3. **Form Submissions** - Test homework submission functionality
4. **Multi-child Scenarios** - Test parent portal with multiple children
5. **File Uploads** - Verify homework file submission works
6. **Date Filtering** - Test attendance date range filtering

## 🎯 **Next Steps for Complete Testing**

1. **Setup Database Environment**
   - Install Supabase CLI or configure cloud instance
   - Run migration `0012_parent_student.sql`
   - Execute seed script to create test data

2. **Authentication Testing**
   - Login as parent user and test all parent portal features
   - Verify role-based access restrictions
   - Test multi-child parent scenarios

3. **Feature Testing**
   - Test homework submission with file uploads
   - Verify attendance tracking and date filtering
   - Validate all API endpoints with real data
   - Test school admin student management interface

4. **UI/UX Testing**
