## 🔧 Current Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Expo Server Starting
**Problem**: Server may not start due to dependency conflicts
**Solution**: Run `npx expo install --fix` to align package versions

### Issue 2: Environment Variables
**Problem**: .env file may be gitignored
**Solution**: Manually create .env file with credentials from ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md

### Issue 3: React Native Compatibility
**Problem**: Some packages may not support React 18.3.1
**Solution**: All packages have been updated to compatible versions

## 🚀 How to Start Testing

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   cd mobile/erp-mobile
   npx expo start
   ```

2. **Scan QR code** with Expo Go app on your device

3. **Login with test credentials**:
   - Use teacher account for testing implemented features
   - Parent features are not yet implemented

4. **Test implemented features**:
   - Teacher Dashboard: Full functionality
   - Teacher Attendance: Complete CRUD operations

## 📋 Next Implementation Priority

1. **Teacher Homework** - Create and manage homework assignments
2. **Teacher Marks** - Enter and manage student marks
3. **Teacher Timetable** - View teaching schedule
4. **Parent Dashboard** - Multi-child support and overview
5. **Parent Attendance** - View child attendance records
6. **Security & Validation** - Implement proper role-based access

## 🏗️ Architecture Notes

The mobile app follows the same patterns as the web application:
- React Query for data fetching
- Supabase for backend operations
- Role-based access control
- Real-time data synchronization
- Optimistic UI updates

All new features should follow the established patterns in the implemented teacher features.
