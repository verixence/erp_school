# Teacher Portal Testing Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** (v18+) and **npm/pnpm** installed
2. **Expo CLI** for mobile testing: `npm install -g @expo/cli`
3. **Expo Go app** on your phone (optional, for mobile testing)
4. **Database access** to Supabase (already configured)

### Environment Setup ‚úÖ
Environment variables have been configured for both applications:
- **Web**: `web/.env.local` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` variables
- **Mobile**: `mobile/teacher-app/.env.local` with `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` variables

## üåê Testing Web Teacher Portal

### 1. Start the Web Application
```bash
# From project root
npm run dev:teacher:web

# This starts Next.js on http://localhost:3001/teacher
# (Port 3001 because 3000 might be in use)
```

- Verify different subjects and sections
- Confirm time slots are realistic

#### Sample Homework
- Existing homework assignments
- Different subjects and due dates
- Some with file attachments

#### Announcements
- School-wide announcements
- Teacher-specific announcements
- Different priority levels

### Test Database Operations

#### Create New Records
- [ ] Create new homework assignment
- [ ] Mark attendance for today
- [ ] Verify data appears immediately on both platforms

#### Data Synchronization
- [ ] Create homework on web ‚Üí appears on mobile
- [ ] Mark attendance on mobile ‚Üí appears on web
- [ ] Real-time updates working

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Web Application Issues

**Issue**: Environment variable errors
```
Solution: Verify web/.env.local has:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

**Issue**: Build failures
```
Solution: Run type checking first:
npm run type-check
```

**Issue**: Database connection errors
```
Solution: Check Supabase project is active and URLs are correct
```

### Mobile Application Issues

**Issue**: TypeScript compilation errors
```
Solution: These are known issues, functionality still works.
To fix: cd mobile/teacher-app && npm install --save-dev @types/react-native
```

**Issue**: Metro bundler issues
```
Solution: Clear cache:
npx expo start --clear
```

**Issue**: Environment variables not loading
```
Solution: Restart Expo dev server after changing .env.local
```
